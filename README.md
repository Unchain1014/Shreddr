# Shreddr

A lightweight, portable drag-and-drop tool for securely shredding and deleting files. Shreddr overwrites file data with random bytes, renames the files to obscure metadata, and then permanently deletes them.

## How It Works

1. **File Overwriting**:
   - Shreddr overwrites the file's contents multiple times with random bytes, making the original data difficult to recover.

2. **File Renaming**:
   - Between overwrite passes, Shreddr renames the file to a random UUID to obscure its metadata (e.g., file name, timestamps).

3. **File Deletion**:
   - After overwriting and renaming, the program permanently deletes the file.

4. **Drag-and-Drop Interface**:
   - The program provides a simple GUI where users can drag and drop one or multiple files to shred them.

5. **Confirmation Prompt**:
   - Before shredding, Shreddr displays a Yes/No confirmation prompt listing all the files to be shredded. This prevents accidental shredding and allows users to review the files.

6. **Summary Prompt**:
   - After shredding, Shreddr displays a summary of all successfully shredded files and any files that failed to shred.

## Why Use Shreddr Instead of the Recycle Bin?

| **Aspect**            | **Recycle Bin**                                                                 | **Shreddr**                                                                                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **File Deletion**      | Files are only moved to the recycle bin and can be easily restored.             | Files are overwritten with random bytes, renamed, and permanently deleted.                     |
| **Data Recovery**      | Files can be recovered using basic tools, even after emptying the recycle bin. | Overwriting and renaming make recovery much harder, especially after multiple passes.           |
| **Metadata Removal**   | Metadata (e.g., file name, timestamps) remains intact.                         | Metadata is obscured by renaming the file to a random UUID during the shredding process.         |
| **Security**           | Minimal security; files are still present on the disk.                        | Provides a secure method of deletion, especially for casual use cases.                          |
| **Ease of Use**        | Simple drag-and-drop to the recycle bin.                                       | Shreddr also provides a drag-and-drop interface for ease of use.                                |
